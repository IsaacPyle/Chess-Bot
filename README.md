# Python Chess Game

A simple python chess game, hopefully with the option to 
either play against another user or a bot player.

## About

Developed as a personal project, this Chess game features all
rules of chess and is about 80% functional at the moment.
The UI is very minimal for now, as I have been working on the 
backend functionality instead. Soon there will be more menus and
a win/lose screen.

## Game look

Planning to add a second option for pieces, and an option for 
other tile colors.

## Usage

All that is necessary to play is to run the main.py file, 
which boots up the game. From there, you can simply move pieces in 
their expected moves, and the game ends when one of the players has 
no possible moves to keep their king from being captured.

## Roadmap

I am planning on many changes in the near future. For starters, 
there are a few minor bugs that need worked out, and a new state 
needs to be added for the end of the game ~~(currently the game just closes.)~~
Thus, my ideas are:

* ~~Fix known bugs (en passant in particular)~~ Done
* Add game end screen <-- Added text, need to add more functionality
* ~~Add castling functionality~~ Done
* Implement basic AI player (checking 1-2 moves into the future?)
* Implement more advanced AI player (using minimax / Alpha-Beta pruning)
* Flippable board to see from Player 2's perspective
